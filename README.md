TwitterTimeline
===============

A data-mining project performed at MHacks 2014. The program would mine a live tweet stream from twitter, filtering tweets based on keywords given by the user, then it would analyze the sentiment of the tweet (Sentiment analysis courtesy of UC Berkeley CS61A staff). Following this the geo-location would be plotted on a SVG map of the globe (D3 API) with the tweets color coded based on tweet sentiment. (Back-end including tweet mining and sentiment analysis is operational, some bugs on the front end still with the javascript code.) Work in progress.
